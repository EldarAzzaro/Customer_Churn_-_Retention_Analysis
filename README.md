# Customer Churn & Retention Analysis

![project_intro](Assets/churn_dashboard.gif)

## Introduction

This project delivers a comprehensive **Customer Churn & Retention** analytics solution using **PostgreSQL** and **Power BI**. It ingests raw telecom-style data, builds SQL data models and views for key metrics (ARPU, MRR, CLV, Churn Rate, Retention Rate, Tenure retention), then visualizes them in an interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers, charts and a star schema model.

### Dashboard File
My final dashboard is in [Churn & Retention Analysis Dashboard](churn_analysis_dashboard.pbix).


## üéØ Key business Questions & Answers

### 1. What is the average monthly churn rate?


The churn rate varies over time ‚Äî it is higher in the early months (e.g., 61.99% in the 1st month) and decreases as customer tenure increases (e.g., 1.66% by the 72nd month).

### 2. Which segments by service type and contract show the highest churn?


From the view vw_churn_by_segment:

Customers on Month-to-Month + Fiber Optic plans have the highest churn rate ‚Äî around 55%.

The lowest churn is seen in Two Year contracts with DSL/No Internet (< 5%).

#### Conclusion: 

Long-term contracts and basic/no internet significantly reduce churn risk.


### 3. How does customer retention change over time?


Customer retention improves significantly as tenure increases. New customers (tenure month 1) have a low retention rate of 38.01%, but this rises steadily, reaching 98.34% by month 72. This suggests that long-term customers are far more likely to stay each month. (Note: less than a month time frame shows 100% retention)



#### Conclusion:

The data reveals a clear pattern: retention rates increase with customer tenure. Early churn is high, but those who stay long-term exhibit strong loyalty, with retention rates exceeding 90% after 5 years. This suggests that efforts to retain customers past the initial months could yield a stable, loyal base.

###  Telco Customer Churn Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Telco Customer Churn** data from Kaggle, which contains real-world customer records and churn status for a U.S. telecom provider.

- **Source:**  
  [Telco Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

**Ingestion & Cleaning:**  
  - Imported as CSV via **Power Query** (handling nulls, type conversions)  
  - Loaded into PostgreSQL table `customers_raw` with `\COPY`  
  - Created lookup tables (`dim_internetservice`, `dim_contract`) and SQL views (`vw_churn_trend`, `vw_retention_by_tenure`, `vw_churn_by_segment`)

## üìä Power BI Dashboard

### 1. Star Schema Data Model


![project_intro](/Assets/star_shema.png
)


- Fact: customers_raw

- Lookup dims: dim_internetservice, dim_contract

- Views: vw_churn_trend, vw_retention_by_tenure, vw_churn_by_segment

### 2. Key DAX Measures


```
// Average revenue per user

ARPU = AVERAGE('public customers_raw'[MonthlyCharges])

// Monthly recurring revenue

MRR = SUM('public customers_raw'[MonthlyCharges])

// Churn Rate by tenure (latest)

ChurnRate = 
  DIVIDE(
    SUM('public vw_churn_trend'[churned_customers]),
    SUM('public vw_churn_trend'[total_customers]),
    0
  )

// Retention Rate

RetentionRate = 1 - [ChurnRate]

// Customer Lifetime Value (forecasted)

CLV = DIVIDE( [ARPU], [ChurnRate], 0 )
```


Formatting:

- ARPU, MRR, CLV ‚Üí Currency ($)

- ChurnRate, RetentionRate ‚Üí Percentage (1 decimal place)





## üì¶ Conclusion

This Customer Churn Analysis dashboard was developed to model and visualize key retention and revenue metrics using real-world telecom‚Äêstyle data. By leveraging PostgreSQL for data modeling and Power BI for interactive reporting, the project delivers insights into customer behavior over their service lifecycle.

Through this dashboard, stakeholders can:

- Monitor the monthly churn rate and identify critical drop-off points in the customer journey

- Analyze retention trends by tenure, highlighting when to intervene for maximum impact

- Compare churn across service types (InternetService) and contract plans to pinpoint high-risk segments

- Track financial
